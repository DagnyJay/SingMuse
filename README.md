# Sing, Muse
## Sing, Muse - A Creativity Prompter ##
My capstone project!

In this age of quarantine and social distancing, creative expression is more important than ever. That's where Sing, Muse comes in. Sing, Muse is a simple writing prompter. It generates three random words for you, you can accept or reject the prompt, but once accepted you have 5 minutes to just write. 

"Stop striving for perfection and write already!"

And check out my deployed app on Heroku at https://singmuse.herokuapp.com

##### Planned Future Enhancements #####
* An About Page!
* Ability to share writings on social media
Ability to delete and edit (just the title) of writings - gotta stick with the mission of no editorializing after the fact!
* Ability for suer to customize how long they want the timer to go for
* Find a better word API - the one I have currently does the trick, but doesn't allow for selecting words by parts of speech or obscurity (i.e, medical terms and extremely niche vocabulary are common currently, which is not ideal)
